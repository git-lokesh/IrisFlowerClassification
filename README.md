## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to automate the classification of iris flowers. The model will use measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to classify iris flowers into one of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

## Project Details

### Iris Species
- The dataset consists of iris flowers from three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
  
### Key Measurements
- Classification is based on measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Machine Learning Model
- A machine learning model will be trained using supervised learning techniques to classify iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Project Summary
### Project Description
The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species using specific measurements. Each iris species exhibits distinct physical characteristics that the model will learn to differentiate.

### Objective
The primary goal is to automate the classification process of iris flowers by training a machine learning model on a dataset containing measurements and corresponding species labels.

### Key Project Details
- Iris flowers are categorized into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
- The model will use sepal and petal measurements to classify iris flowers into these species.
- Supervised learning techniques will be applied to train the model using the provided dataset.

## Results
### Model Evaluation Metrics
I have selected accuracy as the primary evaluation metric for the Iris Flower Classification model. After evaluating several models and tuning parameters, the following results were achieved on the test set:

| Sl. No. | Classification Model | Accuracy (%) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| 1       | K Nearest Neighbors  | 96.67        |
| 2       | Logistic Regression  | 97.50        |
| 3       | Support Vector Machine | 98.33     |
| 4       | Decision Tree        | 95.00        |

### Conclusion
In the Iris Flower Classification project, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model has been selected as the final prediction model due to its highest accuracy on the test set. The project successfully classified iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning techniques.
